    A. Visualization is effective when the perceptual tasks chosen match the data and
    the planned insight of the encoding. If you planned to show that over time a specific relationship
    existed in the data, then you would not want to use a pie chart.
    <br>
    B. The most effective way to encode your data is to design your visualization with your purpose in mind.
    If your purpose is to show high unemployment in Eastern Kentucky, it woukd
    not be useful to show unemployment by state. You would want to show unemployment by county
    so that it would be evident that the level of unemployment in Eastern Kentucky would
    be much higher than the national average. If you are unsure of which visualization type to use
    , try several and pick the one that best fits.
    <br>
    C. When we build visualizations, we need to pay attention to the way the data is related.
    If in one bar chart, you have data that ranges a lot and it is hard to discern differneces
    between some of the data, it may be a good idea to split up your data into multiple charts.
    There is a trade-off based on which data you show. If you want to show things independently
    of other things, then you will need multiple graphics. But if you want to display them together,
    then you have to think about what type of chart allows the specific relations you want for the data.
